# Weekly Reflection

#### Interesting Notes

##### Thing #1
One of my teammates showed the rest of us hackmd, which is basically collaborative
markdown file editing, and it made making the API and design documents so much more 
manageable since we could have multiple people working on it at the same time. It 
only required a bit more communication at the end to see who would push the final 
result but that tradeoff was well worth the benefits.

##### Thing #2
In reviewing my simulation team's resulting API, I realized just how important 
descriptive method naming is to understanding a program at a glance. There were
methods that I am sure I discussed with my teammates at some point that I frankly
didn't know the entire functionality to it and this was after three weeks of working
on the same code. This is something I hope this team improves upon from my last 
team, and something that I can improve on too.

#### Summaries

##### Thing #1
In our Saturday meeting the team decided that we make all of the commands into their 
own objects. This proved to be a step in the seemingly right direction since when we 
got to class on Tuesday, Professor Duvall started talking about a command queue or tree
data structure. This has a straightforward implementation as long as the arguments can 
also be held as command type objects, which was a simple enough change to the overall
process.

##### Thing #2
I learned in the regex reading for the week just how precise one has to be when managing
regular expressions. Something as simple as a misplaced colon can derail the entire process.
This will be very important when implementing the parser since the user commands have to be
read in exactly correct to either run the specified command or throw the appropriate
error.


#### Reflection

##### What was difficult about your work this week and why?
The difficult part of this week was trying to figure out a comprehensive API to build
the Parser program off of. This required us all not only to meet up and agree on the 
same idea, but also to fully understand the necessary components of the project to
ensure our design was adequately flexible.

##### What were the most important things you learned?
The most important thing I learned is how valuable discussing a project can be to one's 
confidence. I went into our initial meeting so scared of how to tackle this project, but
by the end of it I was so ready to get going I had to stop myself and focus on the API's
instead of starting to write a bunch of classes.

##### How will this learning change your work next week?
If I am stuck on a problem, or feeling entirely unmotivated, I should talk to my team first.
We had such a productive first session, and I trust them to be able to work with me through
whatever struggle I'm encountering and get me back on track, just as I hope they feel with
me.
