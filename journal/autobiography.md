# CompSci Autobiography
### NAME

Andrew Krier

#### First Computing Experience

My first experience in using a computer is likely playing web-based games in the basement of my house with my older sister. This was around 2005/06 so I wasn't doing anything major, but that's the first time I learned how to use the buttons and mouse to make meaningful changes on the screen.

#### Why Study CompSci

CS for me has always been an avenue for either individuals or small groups to have a large impact on the world around them with little more than the resources they have with a computer and the internet. It blows my mind away the things that can be made on a computer interface and mastering creating such things is something I want to pursue so that I too can harness the power of computing to make people's lives easier and more fulfilling.

#### My Daily Experiences

My primary use for a computer is web browsing, listening to music, and some light gaming. I occasionally attemt and make my own functions and programs, but the free time to do so is exceedingly lacking.

#### Best (or Worst) Programming Experience

The best coding experience I have had was experimenting with Android Development Studio at HackDuke 2019. No one in our team had any experience in app development, so when we decided to make an app we all had to scramble and learn quickly together. This not only enhanced my team communication and organization skills, but also I learned a lot about how different objects, functions and attributes were managed by one program. This really opened a whole realm of programming even though the end product didn't look too pretty.

#### Most (or Least) Favorite Programming Project



#### Design Thoughts

While my habits are nowhere near good at the moment, I hope to approach each programming problem with care for the overall design first. This will also help me optimize the cruicial aspects of the code, as well as be wary of potential edge cases or common errors.

#### CompSci 308 Goals

I want to leave this class knowing how to design a program relatively from start to finish. I would like to have experience with best practices and writing good code. I also want to increase my efficiency in completing projects, as well as removing any sort of hesitancy in trying to accomplish my goals with regards to programming.

#### Using Programming in the Future

I look to be using coding professionally either as a software developer, or knowing enough to be able to effectively communicate with software engineers to maximize productivity. I also want to be at the funtionality point that I can design and execute my own personal projects for my daily life.
