# CompSci Autobiography
### NAME

Andrew Krier

#### First Computing Experience

My first experience in using a computer is likely playing web-based games in the basement of my house with my older sister. This was around 2005/06 so I wasn't doing anything major, but that's the first time I learned how to use the buttons and mouse to make meaningful changes on the screen.

#### Why Study CompSci

CS for me has always been an avenue for either individuals or small groups to have a large impact on the world around them with little more than the resources they have with a computer and the internet. It blows my mind away the things that can be made on a computer interface and mastering creating such things is something I want to pursue so that I too can harness the power of computing to make people's lives easier and more fulfilling.
