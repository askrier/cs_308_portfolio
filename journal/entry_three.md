# Weekly Reflection

#### Interesting Notes

##### Thing #1
When going through a teammate's code, we encountered a ton of null
pointer exceptions, in trying to work through this, we untangled
a web of ill timed function and constructor calls that were all 
out of order. This will certainly lead me to be very careful in 
the order that I call things in the future, particularly with
JavaFX.

##### Thing #2
Seeing as my aspect of the project was the XML handling, I needed
to manage a lot of data and getting it to the right places. This 
gave me lots of needed experience in managing what should be private
and public, how to get certain data values to their respective 
destinations, and how to properly parse and address XML tags.

#### Summaries

##### Thing #1
So much of my week this week was trying to implement a flexible
array into the XML file to pass to the rest of the program. 
I read so many articles on stack overflow and many others, only
to decide with my team and TA that it was not a route worth pursuing.
This led to a far more straightforward, albeit less satisfying
solution. This only impacted implementation in that the grid
could not support variable row lengths, but this is not a function
our team was looking to implement from the getgo.

##### Thing #2
In my plights to figure out an XML format that could support
multiple layered tags of the same name, I found lots of instructions
on how to accomplish this. One of which involved making a nodeList,
then iterating through it. In trying to insert parts of this in my
code I discovered that only some types of lists are able to be 
iterated through much to my dismay. I was able to get around this, 
but not a subsequent and eventually fatal error. Learning this will
certainly frame how I make lists and iterables in the future.

#### Reflection

##### What was difficult about your work this week and why?
The difficult aspect of my work this week was exploring a whole
new environment in XML. While I had certainly seen it around 
generally, I never had to start a document from the start. This 
really made me prioritize what data was important for the function
of peoples' codes and what was auxiliary and could be extrapolated 
from other data points.

##### What were the most important things you learned?
The most important thing I learned this week was being confident in
making git contributions. This is vital for coding in groups, and 
I feel so much more comfortable with it now than before. I was
terrified of making some small addition that would break everything,
but now even if that does happen I know how to resolve it with far
less difficulty than before.

##### How will this learning change your work next week?
Working in a team is impossible without git these days, I can 
totally forsee using this in a project with my friends (the next
HackDuke?) or in industry with other coders. This week though, 
I can contribute as a much more confident team member than
before, no longer requiring someone walking me through the different
commit messages.
