#### Things Lost
Aside from the winter clothes I left in my dorm room when travelling on spring break that would have certainly come in 
handy living in Minnesota, the primary thing lost was experiences with people that I care about. A full half of a
semester with people I only have a limited time at Duke with will be spent home. While this does mean that I will have
more quality time with my family, it is difficult not to dwell on the connections lost during this time.

#### Concerns and Confidences
A lot of concerns I have are with the stability of my house's internet connection as all five of us will be using it 
heavily and I'm not sure it will handle the strain. I am concerned that the people I care about fall ill, though so far
I have been lucky enough to not know of any cases for those close to me. I am confident that life will return to a 
recognizable normal soon enough, but also that we will need to make sacrifices to get there.

#### Hopes and Positive Outcomes
I hope that those I care about will continue to have good health. I hope that this ends sooner than I anticipate. 

Out of things I can control I want to stay connected to those I care about, particularly senior who would be graduating 
soon, and my older relatives. I want to focus on my studies and improving myself. I am looking forward to consistent and
easy access to a piano in the house so that I can work back up to what was lost these past two years at school.
