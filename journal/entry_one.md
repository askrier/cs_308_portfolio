# Weekly Reflection

#### Interesting Notes

##### I found the pair programming experience to be novel but still a little uncomfortable for me. It was certainly a good exercise to force myself to express my coding decisions aloud, and also showed me that I need to work on my typing WPM. This also gave me a fresh perspective on how others are productive and foster productivity together, certainly something I hope to keep improving on in the future.

##### When trying to get past copying and pasting code from the week one lab, I realized that while I roughly knew what everything did, I really didn't comprehend specifically everything's role and purpose. This led me to scrap the entire lifted part and start over, taking methods and import statements I knew were crucial drivers and filling the holes in my understanding along the way. By the time I was done with it while I had removed some functionality I felt more confident with moving forward and with what I had written.


#### Summaries

##### Code Smells gave me many many issues in code to watch out for. I went back into some of my code in the past and attempted to refactor it to reduce on duplicates, redundancies, shotgun surgeries. One smell I particularly suffered from was the issue of super-long methods. I would always take so many lines and unnecessary calls to switch variables to the proper types and process them, this is something I will strive to improve over the duration of this class.

##### I read through an inheritance tutorial for Java classes and essentially classes will always inherit the variables and methods of its predecessors unless explicitly overwritten in the code. This tutorial included a refresher on constructors and the "this" operator in fully fleshing out a functioning extended class.


#### Reflection

##### What was difficult about your work this week and why?

The most difficult part of work this week was not only getting back into Java for the first time in months, but also convincing myself that I was competent enough to tackle this project. For whatever reason there was something holding me back from getting started; this varied from intimidation to fear of failure, to plainly finding enough time to get a solid foothold on the program. 

##### What were the most important things you learned?

Arguably the most important things I learned were that I reaffirmed my understanding of classes and Java organization, and that nothing will be accomplished if I don't jump in. Taking the initiative on these projects is something that I will need to face head-on this semester.

##### How will this learning change your work next week?

Not only will I start my work earlier, but I will outline a solid plan and follow the steps to implement what needs to be accomplished. This will be especially prudent in working with a partner and having someone to be accountable to other than myself.
